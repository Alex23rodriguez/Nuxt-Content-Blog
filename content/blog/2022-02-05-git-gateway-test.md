# This is only a test

### we'll see what happens

## Installation Types

- CDN
- NPM
- CLI (_Preferred_)
- Vite

### CLI Installation

The `cli` installation is easy but requires prior knowledge of `NodeJS`.

Installing the CLI is as easy as running the following command in your terminal (requires node/npm to be installed).

```sh
yarn global add @vue/cli
# OR
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
